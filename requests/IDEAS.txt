IDEAS:

The API will need more then just CRUD functionality for some data models
    e.g. Requesting to populate the  Subjects taught by a tutor requires;
         *  Subject AND Institution, while you can complete 2 queries and format that data into JSON, 
            would it be easier on the client to only have to make 1 request?

    Another example could be when a login request is made, it may not be suitable to read the entire user object in the database
    to only require username and password validation.

    Solution 1:
    -----------
    have all "read" requests route through <model>/read.php 
        and have a set value to check what kind of request is being made 
            
            e.g. URL = user/read.php?login = true;
                read.php
                <? if(isset(login)
                    run login.php
                    else if(isset(profileView))
                     run profileView.php

    Solution 2:
    ------------
    Not use endpoints to route to other endpoints, but write seperate login.php, viewProfile.php,
    and provide those to the client to use 
        e.g.

           URL = user/login.php        AND
                 user/viewProfile.php
