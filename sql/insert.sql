tutor -> subject(session) -> coordinator -> institution

coordinator_id dilema
----
1) IF an institution who provides the subject (via the coordinator) is dervied from coordinator
  - is it necessary to allow for this relationship 
                e.g.  user 1 -> * institutions

  - if we don't need a multivaraiate relationship user -> instituion, we have to null check institution_id  in user???


how will tutors link to a subject
--------------------------------
  * a link is generated e.g. mijdas.com/api/staff_allocation?id=unique_subject_id  NOTE: should url params be hashed?
  * tutor has 2 fields  username and url.  
  * link is combined to  mijdas.com/api/staff_allocation?id=unique_subject_id, username=<username>


how to link other coordinators
--------------------------------
 * same as above but seperate link for coordinator

coordinators perspective on above
--------------------------------
1)* manage subjets view: 
93:4e:68:35:51:6e:ad:a4:1f:18:89:c7:b2:00:60:75 

2) create advertisment(pre-req) 
    - tutor applies 




account status
--------------
1) unlinked i.e. you've jsut made your account fresh
2) linked via subject (tutor has entered link providedd by coordinator)

3) * linked via institution (for  job board)



big NOTE: Coordinator should have NOT multivariate relation to institiuion HOWEVER, tutors should or job boarding reasons 


* if coordinator, their suject list (subject list page) will populate.  
    SELECT*FROM subject_session WHERE co-orindaotr_id = {loggedinUser.username} (provided by request call)

id     = 1         
subject_id      =CSI203
isActive   = TRUE      
isShared  ?????? 
coordinator_id  = Frank
session_expiry  same as below

id       =2       
subject_id    =CSI203   
isActive      = TRUE   
coordinator_id  = Steve
session_expiry  same as above

 ^^ above
